Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the MobileCoin community and the teams.

The "MCIP" (MobileCoin Improvement Proposal) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the ecosystem, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the protocol is evolving in.

Please see [this document](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mcips/blob/main/README.md) for details.
