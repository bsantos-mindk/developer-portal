MobileCoin could be the foundation for an accessible, secure, and sustainable payments system for the world to use. The best way to create this technology is via a new cryptocurrency and encrypted blockchain.

6.  ### what is MobileCoin’s energy consumption compared to other cryptocurrencies?

While other blockchains take as much energy to run an entire country, you could power all of transactions on the MobileCoin Protocol with the same energy needed to power a few households. Since MobileCoin technology uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement instead of Proof of Work, node servers are mostly idle – they only wake up to do work when there is work to do, saving enormously on energy consumption.
