This section helps developers set up and manage the integration of the MobileCoin Wallet app on a messaging service to
enable its customers to exchange mobilecoins (MOB). 

MobileCoin has developed a Software Developer Kit (SDK) for companies or independent developers who want to develop a
mobile wallet app on a messaging service. This mobile wallet app will enable cryptocurrency users to send and receive
mobilecoins (MOB) via their mobile devices. The MobileCoin SDK Architecture provides a layer of business logic and
cryptographic operations to enable companies and developers to get started quickly in developing their wallet app.
