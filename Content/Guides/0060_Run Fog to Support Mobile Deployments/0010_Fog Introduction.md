# About this Manual

MobileCoin Fog is a scalable service infrastructure that enables a smartphone to manage a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency with locally-stored cryptographic keys. Unique from the public ledger, the Fog Service returns all or some portion of user transactions obliviously to enable operators to look up transactions. The MobileCoin Fog Service is composed of three services and a ledger sync process:

-   Ingest: Processes each transaction in the public ledger according to registered users.

-   Report: Serves the Ingest's pubkey and SGX report to construct transactions (Txos).

-   View: Obliviously provides Txos belonging to registered users.

-   Ledger: Serves the contents of the public ledger obliviously.
