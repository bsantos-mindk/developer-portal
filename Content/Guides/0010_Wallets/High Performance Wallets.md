# High Performance Wallets

MobileCoin has developed a Software Developer Kit (SDK) for companies or independent developers who want to develop a mobile wallet app and will enable cryptocurrency users to send and receive mobilecoins (MOB) via their mobile devices.  This developer-focused documentation explains how to utilize the MobileCoin SDK in a mobile wallet app, including how the Account Key operates, and how to send and receive transactions.
