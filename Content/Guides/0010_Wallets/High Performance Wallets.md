title: High-Performance Wallets
---
The High-Performance Wallet API is a platform which you can use to build wallet services. It provides ledger syncing and validation, account management, and funds transfer and receiving. It uses a JSONRPC API, so you can connect to it from command line tools or build services around its functionality. It serves the use cases of single user (and is the backing to the MobileCoin Desktop Wallet), while also serving high performance, multi-account, multi-subaddress needs (such as backing merchant services platforms). Please see the full API documentation at: [High-Performance Wallet API](https://mobilecoin.gitbook.io/full-service-api/)

## Mobile Wallets
MobileCoin has developed a Software Developer Kit (SDK) for [iOS](/guides/wallet-sdk/ios-app-sdk) and [Android](/guides/wallet-sdk/android-app-sdk) for developers who want to develop a mobile wallet app and will enable cryptocurrency users to send and receive mobilecoins (MOB) via their mobile devices.  This developer-focused documentation explains how to utilize the MobileCoin SDK in a mobile wallet app, including how the Account Key operates, and how to send and receive transactions.
