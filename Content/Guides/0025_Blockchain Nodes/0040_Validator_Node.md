The MobileCoin Consensus Validator is a vital part of a scalable service infrastructure that enables a smartphone to
manage a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency with locally-stored cryptographic keys. A Consensus Validator node, which
runs Intelâ€™s Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), is one type of node that runs in the MobileCoin ecosystem. The validator
node provides defense-in-depth improvements to privacy and trust.

## Running Your Own Consensus Validator Node

To learn more and run a validator node on the MobileCoin network, please review the runbook: [Consensus Validator Node Runbook](https://mobilecoin.gitbook.io/mobilecoin-consensus-fog/)

The key to operating a Consensus Validator Node is trust. It is your responsibilty to only include operators you _trust_ in your quorum set, and for other operators to only include your validator if they trust you. This is vital for the operation of the MobileCoin network.
