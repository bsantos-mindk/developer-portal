This section helps validator node operators set up and manage a remote Consensus Validator node on the MobileCoin Network. The MobileCoin Consensus Validator is a vital part of a scalable service infrastructure that enables a smartphone to manage a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency with locally-stored cryptographic keys. A Consensus Validator node, which runs Intelâ€™s Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), is one type of node that runs in the MobileCoin ecosystem. The validator node provides defense-in-depth improvements to privacy and trust.
