MobileCoin Fog is a suite of services that enable use of MobileCoin payments in resource-constrained environments, particularly, mobile devices. This threat model explains the security invariants of the system for the following audiences:

- Users of MobileCoin Fog
- Developers integrating the MobileCoin SDK into their wallet software
- Parties interested in running a MobileCoin Fog deployment
- Security researchers and auditors curious about the system, or actively attempting to break the system
- We employ the "user-first" approach of Invariant-Centric Threat Modeling in this document.

Below, we describe the hypothetical adversaries of the system, followed by the security invariants provided by the system in the face of each adversary. We also identify specific non-goals in order to express the bounds of what the system specifically cannot do.

Plese see [this document](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/master/fog-threat-model-2.1.0.md) for more details.
