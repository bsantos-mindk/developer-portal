MobileCoin Consensus Service facilitates transactions between MobileCoin users.

Using a modified version of the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf), nodes running the consensus service agree on the content of the blockchain and publish the results. By using Intel's SGX secure enclaves, transactions remain private.

Please see [this doucment](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/master/consensus/service/README.md) for more details.
