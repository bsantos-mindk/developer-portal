title: Transaction Fees
---

Each transaction submitted to the MobileCoin network must pay a fee to the MobileCoin Foundation. The purpose of this fee is to prevent unlimited submission of transactions, which otherwise could be easily abused to degrade users' experience. At the time of writing this, the [minimum fee per transaction](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/acd72e66832c1aa18dc630bcab610c11978af0dd/transaction/core/src/constants.rs) is 0.01 MOB, and is always distributed to the following [address](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/master/consensus/enclave/impl/build.rs) (written in hexadecimal format):

`public view key:\
5222a1e9ae32d21c23114a5ce6bb39e0cb56aea350d4619d43b1207061b10346\
public spend key:\
26b507c63124a2f5e940b4fb89e4b2bb0a2078ed0c8e551ad59268b9646ec241`

There is currently a [plan](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/pull/809) for the minimum fee to be [configurable](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/rfcs/pull/1) in the next version of MobileCoin's protocol. Changing the fee configuration would require a coordinated restart of all validator nodes in the network.
