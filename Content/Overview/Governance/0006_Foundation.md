MobileCoin Governance
=======================================

![](https://mobilecoinwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/padlocks.jpeg)

MobileCoin is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency [launched](https://mobilecoinfoundation.medium.com/mobilecoin-main-net-8e355d82c726) on December 7th, 2020. Its initial [code base](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin) was developed by MobileCoin Inc. and published via the [MobileCoin Foundation](https://mobilecoin.foundation/) with an open-source license (GPLv3).

The MobileCoin Foundation maintains the reference implementation of MobileCoin's (the cryptocurrency's) protocol, along with the 'service-layer' technology known as [Fog](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/fog) that facilitates efficient use of MobileCoin in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, without loss of privacy.

Changes to those reference implementations proposed by MobileCoin Inc. (for example) must be approved by the MobileCoin Foundation's [Technical Committee](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/technical-committee/blob/master/CHARTER.md).
