# Developer Community Calls

If you are a third-party app developer or OSS contributor to the MobileCoin project, you've come to the right place!

Our Developer Community Calls, or dev calls, are monthly calls that give community members an opportunity to demonstrate recent work and discuss open problems and opportunities for contribution. These meetings can have a major impact on the future direction of the MobileCoin project and ecosystem. All are welcome to attend. Please bring your demos, craziest ideas and toughest questions!

**Please note:** We expect that all community members who attend our calls follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). With repeated violations of the Code of Conduct, we will kindly request you to leave our community. This is extremely important, so we can make sure to maintain a warm and welcoming environment for everyone!
