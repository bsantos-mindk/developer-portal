We generally fund projects that can be built in a 6 week to 2-3 month time frame and evaluate proposals based on:

-   The quality of the proposal and near-term value to the MobileCoin ecosystem
-   Your team's technical experience, open source contributions and interest in diving into how MobileCoin works
-   Likelihood that your team will continue to support the MobileCoin ecosystem long-term and commitment to maintaining your project for one year

Note that all proposals must be open sourced via MIT and Apache2 licenses.
