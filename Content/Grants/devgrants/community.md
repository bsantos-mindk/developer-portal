# Open Grants

## About

Do you have an idea for pushing the MobileCoin ecosystem forward? Open grants are intended to support novel ideas that advance the MobileCoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the MobileCoin mission statement. Proposals should include deliverables, milestones, and funding requests. Deviations from the specified scope of the project must be approved between the team and the Foundation grants team.

Here are the priority focus areas, but we welcome proposals from all categories.

- **Core development**: With this track, we will fund collaborators with proposals tackling core protocol research, specification, and implementation work. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:core-dev`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acore-dev).

- **Application development**: We're seeking talented application developers to build useful and delightful applications that utilize MobileCoin as the decentralized storage layer. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:app-dev`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Aapp-dev).

- **Developer tools and libraries**: We are always looking for proposals for the development of developer tools and libraries for both core protocol developers and application developers. Dev tools at all layers of the stack are invaluable! Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:devtools-libraries`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adevtools-libraries).

- **Integration and adoption**: We are interested in supporting the growth of MobileCoin and related technologies via integration into existing app or projects with significant usage. Technical assistance is also available.

- **Technical design**: We want ideas that will improve on the MobileCoin protocol technical design, for example improvement proposals on the core storage protocol, cryptoeconomics design, or on other planned network upgrades. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:technical-design`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Atechnical-design).

- **Documentation**: We understand how crucial documentation is for any open-source project and we welcome proposals to create or improve existing MobileCoin project documentation. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:docs`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adocs).

- **Community**: We would like to support community initiatives throughout the global MobileCoin ecosystem. We have a standing RFP for hosting community meetups, and are generally excited to hear about all sorts of community initiatives. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:community`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acommunity).

- **Metaverse**: We are keen to support work to advance interconnectivity, interoperability, and openness at any layer in the growing tide of virtual, immersive worlds (experiences, applications, communities, tooling, standards, infrastructure, et cetera).

- **Research**: We are keen on receiving proposals that explore the meta processes and incentives of decentralized storage. Relevant proposals should be labeled  [`category:research`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3research).

- **Green Grants**: We are interested in proposals for tools, applications, libraries or models for optimizing energy use on the MobileCoin network, allowing dApps to assess their environmental impacts, or using Web3 to make reporting more transparent and verifiable.

## 📋 How to apply

To submit an Open Grant proposal, [create a new issue](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=open-grant-application.md&title=) using the Open Grants Proposal template.

Open Grant proposals are reviewed monthly.

## ⌛ After you apply

After you submit your proposal, you can expect the following to occur:

- We will review your application. During review, we will add comments, questions, change requests, et cetera on your team's submission.

- After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals to fund and which not to. <!--Accepted proposals will be merged into the appropriate directory, i.e. either [`open-grant`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/open-grant) or [`rfp-proposals`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/rfp-proposals).-->

- During the discussion and review phase, we will contact your team for financial and legal follow-ups, such as to confirm milestones and funding, your team's legal structure, etc.

- If your team is accepted, we will ask you to sign our Open Source Software Grant Agreement, which will include a copy of the work plan and funding milestones.

If a repo has a Contributing Guide, please read it before filing an issue!

### Security issues and disclosures

Almost anything you find that is a bug in the codebase should be filed as an issue. The exception is if you find a security vulnerability. The MobileCoin protocol is still under heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocol design or implementations. Though MobileCoin is not yet production-ready, many people are already running nodes on their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously! If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

Please refer to [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) document found in this repo on how to best report findings and participate on the bug bounty program.

## Ecosystem Projects

If your project uses MobileCoin, you're in the MobileCoin ecosystem! We'd love to see all awesome projects that are built on top of the MobileCoin ecosystem to be known and get used by the MobileCoin community!

### Showcase Your Project!

Following the steps below to submit your projects to be featured in this [repo](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/tree/master/projects):

- Create a project profile using the [project submission template](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/blob/master/templates/project-submission-template.md). Name the file name after your project and fill in as much information as you can.  Use your project name as the file name so the community can find your project easily!

- Create a new discussion thread in this repository's [Discussions > Project Showcase](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/discussions/categories/project-showcase), titled `[Category] Project Name`(i.e: `[Application] Slate`). Add this link to the "How the community can engage" section. Use this thread to share your updates, and chat with users and potential users!

- Once the project profile is ready, create a [PR](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/pulls), prefix `[Project Submission]` in the title, and request a review from one of the [maintainers](#maintainers).

- Let the maintainer know if you want your [updates](#updates-and-newsletter) to be featured in [MobileCoin newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/MobileCoin.io/subscribe) or not in the PR description!

- If everything looks good, the maintainer will merge the PR and voila, your project is now featured here!

### Updates and Newsletter

We'd encourage all projects featured in this repo to share all of your thrilling updates with the community! Start a new comment with header `Project Name Update/Newsletter - Date` (i.e `## Slate Update - Feb, 2021`) in your project discussion to share the exciting news with the community!

## Events

Add our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/6?cid=ZmlsZWNvaW4ub3JnX2o3bW1ldjI0ZzgwcmVsbzU2cHFtMWVsMWUwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) or follow issues in this repo to keep track of events (meetups, hackathons, etc.) hosted by the MobileCoin Project and/or Protocol Labs.

### Community calls

Our community calls are venues for all MobileCoin Project community members to meet each other, share demos of recent work, discuss open problems, and more. We expect these calls to be extremely respectful venues where all community members follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and treat each other (i) as they would like to be treated and (ii) as they would treat each other in real life.

All community calls are **open for anyone to join**. However, we recommend that you take a look at each call's agenda (which can be found on GitHub issues under the label [`agenda`](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/labels/agenda)) to make sure the call will be a good use of your time. We do our best to group similar demos and other agenda items together in the same call so it is easier to choose calls that you would like to attend.

Furthermore, we hold different calls for different communities. If you are a third-party app developer or OSS contributor, you might be interested in attending our **monthly development community calls** that are geared towards topics that developers will find useful. We also hold occasional **mining community calls** that are geared towards the needs of MobileCoin miners.

Feel free to attend whichever calls are interesting to you. All calls are recorded, and the recording will be posted online at this repo.

Learn more about:

- [Development Community Calls](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/blob/master/community-calls/dev-calls/dev-calls.md)

- [Mining Community Calls](https://github.com/MobileCoin-project/community/blob/master/community-calls/mining-calls/mining-calls.md)

We will announce each upcoming community call by making announcements in our [chat channels](#chat) and [website](https://MobileCoin.io/build/#events).

### MobileCoin Meetups

MobileCoin meetups are a great way to meet and connect with other developers and miners in your community that are using and learning about MobileCoin.
