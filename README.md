Welcome to the MobileCoin developer documentation! This repository contains the content for the [MobileCoin developer portal](https://developers.mobilecoin.com). If you are looking for the portal, please go there. If you intend to submit a change to the developer docs, please read the below structural guidelines.

# Site Structure

The "Content" folder represents the starting point for all site content. Anything above that in the file structure will be ignored, as will any README files within the site content folders.

The "Overview," "How-to Guides," "Community," and "FAQ" folders just underneath the main content folder map directly to the corresponding sections in the developer portal.

Documents in "Overview," "How-to Guides," and "FAQ" will be constructed into traditional documentation format with a linked table of contents. Files will render into html from the markdown, while directories will be interpreted as subgroup headings.

# Markdown, Directories, and Metadata

## Tables

The Developer Portal uses GFM as its markdown interpreterâ€”anything that would render here in GitHub should render on the site as expected. HTML is also allowed. A note that when making tables, please remember to include the heading dividers and that line breaks can break the table:

| heading | heading |

| ------- | ------- | <-- important!

| data    | data    |

## Alerts

Using the following formatting items will render the line as an information block, a warning block, or an error block:

?> this is helpful information

!> this is a warning

x> this is an error

## Filenames

Pages and subgroups will render *in the order they appear in the directory*. For best results, please add a four-digit number to the start of files and folders, followed by an underscore:

**0010_document.md**

This will ensure they appear in the intended order on the final site.

## Headers and Metadata

All site markdown files should include a YAML-style header which allows The following parameters. This will allow pages to better generate their meta tags, and give some more control over the appearance of things.

```
---
title: "optional. Recommended in quotes to avoid formatting faux-pas. A missing title will use the filename starting after the first _ character. Pages will draw this title as an h1 at the top of the document."
author: "optional. The original author of the page, if desired."
description: "optional. text to be used as the description in meta tags and in internal search previews."
hide_title: optional boolean. When true, doesn't render the title given in this header on the page, for when you want to include it yourself.

```
